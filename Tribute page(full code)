        <h3>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, renowned as the "Missile Man of India," was a distinguished scientist and the 11th
            President of India (2002-2007). Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he spearheaded
            India's
            missile and nuclear weapons programs. His contributions include the development of the Satellite Launch
            Vehicle (SLV-III) and advancements in ballistic missile technology. Despite his prestigious roles, Kalam
            maintained humility and a passion for inspiring youth, advocating for science education and innovation.
            His
            simplicity and dedication endeared him to the nation. Even after his presidency, Kalam continued to
            champion
            education and authored bestselling books, leaving a lasting legacy worldwide.</h3>
