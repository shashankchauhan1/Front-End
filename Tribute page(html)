            President of India (2002-2007). Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he spearheaded
            India's
            missile and nuclear weapons programs. His contributions include the development of the Satellite Launch
            Vehicle (SLV-III) and advancements in ballistic missile technology. Despite his prestigious roles, Kalam

            His
            simplicity and dedication endeared him to the nation. Even after his presidency, Kalam continued to
